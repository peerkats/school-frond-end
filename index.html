<article>
<p>Hello, my name is Peer, and I am 17 years old. I am a Dutch programmer eager to learn and passionate about building applications. I was born in the Netherlands and moved to Sweden when I was one year old. I lived in Sweden until I was eight, where I learned the language very well.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects and going to the gym. Currently, I am studying software development at TCR in Alexandrium, Rotterdam. I live in Berkel en Rodenrijs.</p>

<p>Before pursuing software development, I attended the Melanchthon school, where I completed HAVO and VWO programs. However, I realized that they weren't the right fit for me, so I decided to focus on programming instead.</p>

<p>My journey has been filled with diverse experiences, from living in different countries to exploring various educational paths. Through it all, my passion for programming has remained a constant. I am committed to continuing my education and honing my skills to become an accomplished software developer.</p>

<p>I look forward to the future, where I can apply my knowledge and creativity to develop innovative applications.</p>

            <article>
                <p>I have been passionate about programming since I was young. I started with learning Python, creating small CLI programs, and gradually moved on to more advanced system-level programming languages like C and Rust. My interest in Linux led me to explore it deeply as well. During my time at TCR, I gained proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am in my first year of studying software development at TCR. Throughout my studies, I have completed numerous projects, which you can explore via the GitHub link below. I have also included a picture of a side project I am working on a 2D game developed entirely in Rust using small libraries, without relying on a game engine.</p>

                <p>My journey in programming has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to constantly improve my skills and tackle new problems. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and contributing to exciting projects in the future.</p>
